To Do List
==========

☐ load in all the participants! (in batches of 1 each)
	☐ DataLoader will call makeX
	  and DataLoader.read_data will return batches:
	  a list of pytorch variables with tensors in them
	  (each batch is one participant)
	  [all of us?]
	☑ makeX will call makeXs once for each participant
	  makeXs will return a *list* of np arrays, not a tensor
	  [Desmond]	  
☐ add batches to train(), e.g. for batch in batches...
☐ load transcript features into model
☐ visualize things
	☐ learning curves [Marissa]
	☐ features (just for funsies) [Erin]
	☐ plot model predictions and actual labels against time [Marissa]
☐ tune model architecture
☐ wat iz time delay
